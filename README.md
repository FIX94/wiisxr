# WiiSXR
Fork of wiisx, a GameCube/Wii/Wii U PSX emulator.

The starting point for this code base will be daxtsu's libwupc mod of wiisx, which is in turn based off of Matguitarist's "USB mod5"

Please see the following link for details:

WiiSX is GNU GPL and the source can be found here:

LibWupc is also GPL, which can be found here:

https://github.com/FIX94/libwupc

Please contact me if you have licensing concerns. I will try to make this as GPL2+/3+ compliant as possible.

##Goals

The aim of this project is to maintain, update and improve the wiisx code to comply with building with the latest devkitPro (PPC), website can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitPPC/

Some Goals in mind:

- Fix build warnings and errors (see buildwarnings.log for details)
- Update with code from pcsxr (as wiisx is based on pcsx and pcsxr is still actively maintained with great compatibility: http://pcsxr.codeplex.com)
- Port to c++ (to make it more aligned with pcsxr and easier to update as needed)

Don't forget to fork me! :)
I'm open to collaborators!
